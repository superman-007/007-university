# 0 Why I want to write this?

Writing in non-native-language is very chanlenging for majority. That's the reason why I wanted to create a special writing commnity for ambitious people like you. However, the community is not very active, and the half didn't write anything since the 007-superman's establishment. Therefore I need to write a simple specification for our community.

# 1 The Writing Rules Details

## 1.1 Where do we write?

I strongly suggest you all write essays on **steemit.com**. Because the blockchain properties from steemit can drive you write more, the more you write, the higher probability you would get dollars like 币乎. But getting steemit account is not easy, jianshu(简书) is the second option.

## 1.2 How often do we write?

After the temporary running of 007-Superman, we have found that the English levels of us are different. So the members should be splited into two categories: one is the senior membership, and another is the normal membership.

- **Senior members** have to deliver one aricle per week.
- Normal members should commit one article per 2 weeks.

## 1.3 When do we commit writings

I would like to make our commiting time more flexible, therefore I think you guys can commit your masterpiecies in any time. But the writing statistics wll be done on the 007 officail commiting day, the details of censusing writing will be hosted on [Our Github page](https://github.com/superman-007/007-university/blob/master/write_status.md)

## 1.4 How do we commit

At present, you just need to send your writing links into the WeChat group to commit. I will collect the links into our [statistical document](https://github.com/superman-007/007-university/blob/master/write_status.md).

# 2 To be continued

As the progress we will make in the future, the specification will be updated.
